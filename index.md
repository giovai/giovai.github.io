Welcome to my Github Pages.

# Who Am I?

A Cloud Platform Engineer experienced in implementing cloud solutions with a focus on AWS services, platform engineering and Infrastructure as Code. Skilled in developing and maintaining CI/CD pipelines and monorepos, with strong background in e-commerce platforms and hands-on experience in GraphQL, TypeScript and event-driven systems. Currently expanding my skill set in Go and Kubernetes.

## What Have I Been Up To?

With over a decade of experience in eCommerce, working for small and big consultancies as a BE Developer and a Tech Lead, I am now looking for a change.

Over the years, I have developed interest in DevOps practices and Platform Engineering. Next to my day-to-day application development responsibilities, I started to casually learn how is my code deployed. First on monolithic, Java/Spring projects using Jenkins, now on Typescript/IaC MACH (microservices) projects using Github Actions or Azure DevOps.

**Take a look at my [experience](./resume.html).**

## Where Am I Going?

These days, I mainly focus on exploring Internal Developer Platform (IDP) concepts and improving the Developer Experience in Cloud Native setups (which at the moment means training in Kubernetes and Go).

In the future, I’d like to be able to use these skills in the Impact Sector and work On Purpose.
